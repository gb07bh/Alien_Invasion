# Alien_Invasion

Hello User,<br>
I have developed this Game with reference to Eric Matthes Python Crash Course.<br>
The Game however has been updated.<br>
Below mentioned are some of the added features :- <br>
1. The Ship moves in all directions (up, down, left, right).<br>
2. Sound effects have been added to make the game more interesting.<br>
3. Vibrancy of colours to attract user's attention. <br>
